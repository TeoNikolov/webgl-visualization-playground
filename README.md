# webgl-visualization-playground
  This web application is for vizualising different types of vizualisations with WebGL, with a focus on allowing the user to control said vizualisations.
  I originally started simply because I wanted to learn WebGL and write some shaders to create visual art, but later down the line I figured I was doing things slow and wanted to make the process faster.
  
  Currently the project is being rewritten with TypeScript (Angular) to make the creation of user controls automatic and simpler so I can focus on the vizualisations themselves when I wish to.
  
  Some ideas I want to develop:
  
  * toggle-able HUD panels (should be easy)
  * panel containing the source of current vizualisation, letting the user upload a modified version of the shader(s) used (alternatively, create a completely new shader)
  * ability to save/reset settings (via cookies/sessions). Maybe in the future some basic login system could be used to POST/GET information to/from a server with DBMS
